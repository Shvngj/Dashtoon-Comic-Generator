### **Objective:**

Develop a simple web application that allows users to create and share a 10-panel comic strip. The comic is generated by inputting text into a form, which is then sent to a text-to-image API using a provided API key.

### Project Structure

- We have the app in our `app.tsx` file.
- We have our components in the components folder like ComicTextInput.tsx, ComicPanel.tsx and ComicBoard.tsx.
- Comic Board acts as the base layout for the comic strips. 
- Comic Panel refers to the singular panel of the comic strips.
- Comic Text Input file contains the code for the input provided by the user.
- We can select the panel from the dropdown and the corresponding image would be inserted in that panel. The panel and their images are managed using state variables.
- An individual can add Annotations using the Annotation field text box provided at the top-left and bottom-right corners of the panel. Similary, clearing the text in the Annotation field removes the Annotations.


### Deployment
The web app is deployed on Vercel: [https://dashtoon-comic-generator-olive.vercel.app/](https://dashtoon-comic-generator-olive.vercel.app/)
The website is compatible with all platforms including desktop and mobile.
